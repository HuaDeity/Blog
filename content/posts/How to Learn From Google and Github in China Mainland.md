## Introduction

As a programmer, it is very important to have a steady access to Github and Google to learn the latest technologies. For some well-known reasons, getting access to these learning materials in mainland China is slightly more complicated.
So, I'll introduce some of the most basic methods here.

## General Knowledge

1. VPN is not used to get access to these learning materials. The full name of VPN is Virtual Private Network, it is used to protect privacy, and its flow characteristics are obvious. (For more detailed sections, please study Computer Networks)
2. It is illegal, so please use it only for study.
3. Based on the above two points, we need to connect to the foreign server through a special protocol. The organization that provides this service is called Airport, and if you have the appropriate technical skills, you can also buy your own foreign VPS (Virtual Private Server) to build such service. Airports are not compliant, so please take care of privacy.

## Proxy Apps

We need proxy apps to connect to the services provided by the airport or to the services we build ourselves.
Here are some recommendations:

## Config

In order to spread across various practical needs to access domestic websites normally with proxies on, we need to divert the network traffic. That is, for domestic traffic to take a direct connection, for foreign traffic to proxy.
Here are some lazy configurations:
